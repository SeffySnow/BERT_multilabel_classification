# Multi-Label Classification with BERT
## Introduction
This repository demonstrates a multi-label classification pipeline using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) applied to a dataset of consumer reviews. The project is designed to classify reviews into multiple labels simultaneously, such as "Materials," "Construction," "Color," "Finishing," and "Durability."

Key Features:
* Text preprocessing and cleaning tailored for BERT.
* Multi-label classification with PyTorch and Transformers.
* Evaluation metrics include F1-score, precision, recall, and a detailed classification report.
